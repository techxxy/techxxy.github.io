It's been quite some time since I've found myself immersed in an HTML and CSS frenzy.

Allow me to make a confession. Once upon a time, I found myself working tirelessly on weekends, spending countless hours refactoring HTML code for Java + JSP projects. This endeavor spanned over two weeks, grappling with around 100 pages entrenched in the archaic technologies of the last century. I believe it was during the transition from HTML2 to HTML3. Opening these files in Eclipse with warnings enabled was a perilous task, as the sheer volume of warnings and errors almost always caused the program to crash. For a period, warnings should have remained turned off.

In today's landscape, it seems that CSS has the power to conjure magic, making the seemingly impossible achievable. Inspired by this notion, I decided to put my skills to the test. And voil√†! I successfully crafted a visually striking keyboard without relying on a single image. Its sleek, 3D appearance left me feeling immensely satisfied with the outcome.

This particular keyboard design is modeled after a Korean-German Apple Keyboard. While it exudes a remarkable level of realism, it's important to note that this does not exist in the real world. Koreans use a Korean-English (QWERTY) keyboard layout rather than the Korean-German (QWERTZ) configuration.

However, as with many creative endeavors, there are always caveats. While the keyboard functions admirably on desktop platforms, it struggles on mobile devices, burdened by its weightiness and lack of adaptability to varying screen sizes. Despite these challenges, I remain undeterred. That's why front-end technologies and libraries like React, Vue.js, Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS exist, offering a plethora of tools and libraries to streamline development. I am more than willing and ready to utilize any of these resources to overcome the obstacles at hand.
