During the process of building a Korean virtual keyboard, I uncovered many hidden complexities behind what seemed like a simple tool. Little did I know that even the backspace key in a virtual keyboard could present such a challenge to implement. I'm eager to share the intriguing journey I embarked on while constructing the virtual Korean keyboard. Even the most mundane keystrokes in an input box led to unexpectedly exciting discoveries.

King Sejong the Great, the true genius behind the invention of the Korean script system, once claimed that a clever person could learn the Korean script within half a day, while even a less intelligent individual could grasp it within a week. However, from my own experiences, I've learned that blind trust in the words of a genius may not always bring peace of mind. It's worth noting that King Sejong himself often chastised the most intelligent individuals of his time for their perceived foolishness.

Nevertheless, it's undeniable that the Korean script is a fascinating system, reflective of a clever and innovative mind, much like the internet or a computer.

If you're intrigued by Korean culture and language, I'd be delighted to delve deeper into the subject. Please feel free to reach out and leave a comment. Admittedly, there's currently no comment function on this website, and there may never be one. However, don't let that deter you from engaging in conversation!
